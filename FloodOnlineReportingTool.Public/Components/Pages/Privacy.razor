<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What data is collected</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        This website collects property and location data on flooding so authorities can do their legal duties. 
        We use the answers you give about the location and source of flooding to make sure your report reaches the 
        correct authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not keep contact information or comments and media containing personal data for longer than 
        @(DataRetentionYears) years unless agreed with you and where there is a valid reason. Personal data may be removed 
        in advance of this by the relevant record lead.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act</a> requires that we define the lawful basis 
        of how we process personal data. This website processes data under 'Public Task' to perform a task in the 
        public interest for official functions. Data collected on this site is used to fulfil the Lead Local Flood Authority 
        functions as detailed in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/29/contents">Flood and Water Management Act 2010</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who is processing personal data?</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        You are responsible for the content you upload to this website, however once uploaded this website 
        (administered by Dorset Council) takes on the role of data processor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data collected is passed to the relevant Lead Local Flood Authority who act as the data controller. 
        In some cases, they may share this responsibility with other risk management organisations such as 
        the Environment Agency and utility companies. Other organisations investigating floods may also look at the data 
        but will not be given access to personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have queries about your data, contact the relevant data controller in the first instance 
        and each organisation using <abbr title="Flood online reporting tool">FORT</abbr> will provide their own privacy 
        statement in addition to this one.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who will the data be shared with?</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Data submitted on this website is shared with:
        <ul>
            <li>Lead Local Flood Authorities</li>
            <li>Environment Agency</li>
            <li>emergency services</li>
            <li>
                other organisations who need the data to assist them with analysis, planning or emergency response
                to flooding
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data may be used to plan future flood defence schemes and to inform the public about whether there is 
        a risk of flooding. All non-personal data is subject to Freedom of Information and Environmental 
        Information Requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal data is only available to record leads, however as this can change during an investigation all the 
        privacy statements for the geographical area are provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not share your personal data with external companies or use it for marketing purposes unless you have 
        agreed for this to happen. This currently only applies to media where you have permitted us to 
        use it in publications.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Protecting your personal data</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Make sure you don't include personal information in comments (except where specifically permitted) and that all 
        media is edited so that no living person can be identified. Any personal data in media or comments will be 
        removed by authorised <abbr title="Flood online reporting tool">FORT</abbr> users before being shared with 
        project partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data will be retained until the relevant risk authority no longer needs it, or for a maximum period of 
        @(DataRetentionYears) years. If a flood report is actively under investigation or subject to a grant application, 
        this period may be extended as required.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Will all records be investigated?</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Not all reports will be individually investigated and some will be used for statistical purposes.
    </p>
</div>

@* TODO - rewrite this section once process is clear *@
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Access, deletion and updating of records</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        You can update your report for as long as the record is being processed.
        This will allow you to remove personal data but a historical copy of the original text will be retained until the processing is completed or the data retention period is exceeded.
        It is only possible to completely remove a record if it can be proved that the record was incorrectly entered and it may not be possible if the data has been used in a report.
        In such cases it is possible to record an updated version to prevent its inclusion in further reports and analysis.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Please Note:</strong> we use email as the primary method of communication relating to processing of your report.
    You will be sent details of how to access and update your record via an email from fort@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk.
    Should you wish to prevent further communication you should update your record and remove the email address.
