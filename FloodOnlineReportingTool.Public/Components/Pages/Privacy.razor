<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What data is collected</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        This website collects property and location data on flooding. We use the answers you give to make sure your report 
        reaches the correct authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not keep contact information, comments or media containing personal data for longer than 
        @(DataRetentionYears) years unless agreed with you and where there is a valid reason. Personal data may be removed 
        in advance of this by the relevant record lead.
    </p>  
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who is processing personal data?</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        This website (administered by Dorset Council) takes on the role of data processor when you provide your data and 
        report a flood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data collected is passed to the relevant Lead Local Flood Authority who act as the data controller. 
        In some cases, they may share this responsibility with other risk management organisations such as 
        the Environment Agency and utility companies. Other organisations investigating floods may also look at the data 
        but will not be given access to personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have queries about your data, contact the relevant data controller in the first instance 
        and each organisation using this website will provide their own privacy statement in addition to this one.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who will the data be shared with?</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Data submitted on this website is shared with:
        <ul>
            <li>Lead Local Flood Authorities</li>
            <li>Environment Agency</li>
            <li>emergency services</li>
            <li>
                other organisations who need the data to assist them with analysis, planning or emergency response
                to flooding
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data may be used to plan future flood defence schemes and to inform the public about flood risks. 
        All non-personal data is subject to Freedom of Information and Environmental Information Requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal data is only available to record leads, however as this can change during an investigation all the 
        privacy statements for the geographical area are provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not share your personal data with external companies or use it for marketing purposes unless you have 
        agreed for this to happen. This currently only applies to media where you have permitted us to 
        use it in publications.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Lawful basis for processing data</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Our lawful or legal basis for using your information <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/">can be found here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Article 6.1(e) of the GDPR: “Public Task”</strong> “processing is necessary for the performance of a task
        carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller”
    </p>
    <p>
        Data collected on this site is used to fulfil the Lead Local Flood Authority functions as detailed in the
        <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/29/contents">Flood and Water Management Act 2010</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Protecting your personal data</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Any personal data in media or comments will be removed by authorised users or automated detectors before being 
        shared with project partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data will be retained until the relevant risk authority no longer needs it, or for a maximum period of 
        @(DataRetentionYears) years. If a flood report is actively under investigation or subject to a grant application, 
        this period may be extended as required.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Will all records be investigated?</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        No, not all reports will be individually investigated and some will be used for statistical purposes.
    </p>
</div>

@* TODO - rewrite this section once process is clear *@
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Access, deletion and updating of records</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        You can update your report for as long as the record is being processed.
        This will allow you to remove personal data but a historical copy of the original text will be retained until the processing is completed or the data retention period is exceeded.
        It is only possible to completely remove a record if it can be proved that the record was incorrectly entered and it may not be possible if the data has been used in a report.
        In such cases it is possible to record an updated version to prevent its inclusion in further reports and analysis.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Please Note:</strong> we use email as the primary method of communication relating to processing of your report.
    You will be sent details of how to access and update your record via an email from fort@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk.
    Should you wish to prevent further communication you should update your record and remove the email address.
